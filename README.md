App for online shoping

The app is built with React, Bootstrap, SCSS, and TypeScript. I am using the SoftUni practice server.

To start the app, first navigate to the "server-plp" folder and then run the command "node server.js" in the terminal. In the "server.js" file, you will find all the static items with the name "seedData," starting from line 1335 of the code. You can add data if needed, but remember that the _id must be unique. After making any changes, remember to restart the server.

There is already data present on the server.

Next, navigate to the "plp-app" folder and run the command "npm run dev" in the terminal.The app will be running at http://localhost:5173/. You can also directly start the app by holding the "ctrl" key and clicking on http://localhost:5173/.

Now, you have the app running. If you refresh the app, it will reload to the default page, which displays bags items.
